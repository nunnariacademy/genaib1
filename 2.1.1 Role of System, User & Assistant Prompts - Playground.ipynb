This process not only produces energy for the plant but also helps remove excess carbon from the atmosphere, thus playing a significant role in maintaining Earth's climate system.\n",

       "3. **Glucose Production**: The remaining water and carbon dioxide are converted into glucose, a simple sugar that the plant can use as fuel.\n",

       "\n",
       "The oxygen produced is released into the atmosphere through tiny pores on leaves called stomata. Meanwhile, glucose serves as a primary food source for the plant, and carbon dioxide from the surrounding air becomes part of this cycle by being used during photosynthesis.\n",

The data comes in from ports around the world - input devices such as keyboards or microphones can bring information into our digital engine room, while output devices like speakers or screens send back what it has processed.\n",

       "The heart of our ship is its Central Processing Unit, or CPU for short. This is where all the magic happens! The CPU takes instructions from programs and executes them by performing mathematical operations, logical computations, and even manipulations on data stored within itself - much like how a captain steers his ship by controlling the helm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, let's talk about memory. In our digital engine, we have two types: Random Access Memory (RAM) for quick access to information that needs to be processed immediately; it's where all the current work is done and where most of your computer’s programs are loaded into.\n",
       "\n",
       "The CPU communicates with other components through a network of wires called busses. The motherboard acts as our bridge, connecting everything together smoothly, much like how a captain guides his ship across calm seas.\n",

       "The provided `calc` function is designed to take two inputs (`x`, `y`, and `z`) and multiply their sum by the third input. The function returns either `\"big\"` or `\"small\"`. This behavior depends solely on whether the result of multiplying `x + y` by `z` exceeds 100.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Issues Found\n",
       "1. **Redundant Operation**: There is an unnecessary operation that occurs both in the calculation and in the conditional block.\n",
       "2. **Magic Number**: The constant value `100` should be replaced with a defined variable for better readability.\n",
       "3. **Potential Side Effects**: If any part of this function could potentially mutate input values (e.g., through global variables), it's important to understand what happens if the function is called multiple times.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Suggested Improvements\n",
       "1. **Remove Redundant Calculation**:\n",
       "   - Remove unnecessary computation in the return statement.\n",
       "   \n",
       "2. **Define a Variable for 100**:\n",
       "   - Use `MAX_VALUE` as a named constant, making the intent clearer and more maintainable.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Consider Global Variables** (Optional):\n",
       "   - If this function is part of a larger application where it might mutate input values, consider defining constants in a separate file or using a different method to manage such variables.\n",
       "   \n",
       "Here’s how you can refactor the code:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "MAX_VALUE = 100\n",
       "\n",
       "def calc(x, y, z):\n",
       "    result = x + y\n",
       "    if result * z > MAX_VALUE:\n",
       "        return \"big\"\n",
       "    else:\n",
       "        return \"small\"\n",
       "\n",
       "# Example usage:\n",
       "print(calc(5, 3, 4))  # Should output: small\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "### Explanation of Changes\n",
       "1. **Redundant Operation Removed**:\n",
       "   - The line `result = result * z` is now unnecessary because the function already has a valid value (`x + y`) to multiply by.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Magic Number Replaced with Constant**:\n",
       "   - Changed the constant value from 100 to MAX_VALUE, making it clear what 100 represents and improving readability.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Optional Global Variable Handling (Not Required in This Case)**:\n",
       "   - If you decide that this function should operate globally or if any part of it might mutate inputs, defining constants can be useful for maintaining clean code and avoiding side effects."

    "| **Multi-turn** | Including prior assistant messages gives the model conversation context |\n",
    "| **Specificity** | More detailed system prompts = more controlled outputs |\n",

    "| **Guardrails** | Use system prompts to constrain the model's scope and behavior |"
